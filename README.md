### TinyTeX - Tex Live distribution
> Experimental - this could still change

3 binaries are available from [tinytex-releases](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex-releases) but only one can be installed at the same time. That is because a _shim_ for `tlmgr` command is added to _scoop_ and available to PATH, and that would be overriden. (And honestly, you only need one). 

* `tinytex` contains [several tex packages already installed](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/blob/master/tools/pkgs-custom.txt) that are the main one used by Rmarkdown. If you are an R user we recommand this one. 
* `tinytex-min` is infra-only and contains only Tex Live with no package installed. Use this one if you want only Tex Live for Windows using [TinyTeX distribution](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) without the selected packages, for CI workflow for example. 
* `tinytex-extra` contains some extra packages installed compare to `tinytex`.

See full documentation at https://yihui.org/tinytex/ and about the releases at https://github.com/yihui/tinytex-releases#scoop-package

The binaries are synced from https://github.com/yihui/tinytex-releases/releases

### R 

#### R devel

You can install R devel for Windows using this bucket containing the `r-devel` app. The version will be synced to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html and you will always have the last available r-devel version, tracked by the version notation like r79818 for the current development snapshot of R. As any other app, a new version will be checked for daily. 

This scoop installed app will behave like with the apps in the _Versions_ bucket (https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Versions): You can have several versions of R installed with scoop but only one in use. You will have to use [`scoop reset`](https://scoop-docs.now.sh/docs/misc/Switching-Ruby-and-Python-Versions.html#scoop-reset) to switch between installed versions.

```powershell
# from this bucket
scoop install r-devel
rterm --version # r-devel

# from the main bucket
scoop install r-release
rterm --version # r current release

# switching back to use r-devel
scoop reset r-devel
rterm --version # r-devel
```

#### rig - R Installation Manager

rig, the R Installation Manager, (https://github.com/r-lib/rig) is a tool to install, remove, configure R versions. 

This bucket contains the manifest to install and update easily the [rig CLI](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases) for Windows. 

```powershell
# install
scoop install rig

# update
scoop update rig
```

Using `rig`, you can then install and manage any R versions. See `rig help` for details.

#### R release and old releases

If you prefer installing R versions with scoop, you can can 

- install R current release.

```powershell
scoop install r-release
```

- or install a previous release

```powershell
scoop install r-release@3.5.2
```

You can then switch between R versions (including r-devel - see below) using 

```powershell
scoop reset r-release
scoop reset r-release@3.5.2
```

[R Installation Manager (RIM)](#r-installation-manager-rim), installable from this bucket too, is a better tool for installing R versions.

### Quarto CLI

Quarto (https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy to write plain text format.

This bucket contains the manifest to install and update easily the [quarto CLI](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases) for Windows. 

**Quarto is still in heavy development and the last available daily build will be installed**

```powershell
# install
scoop install quarto

# update
scoop update quarto
```
